Cafe: 
    User specifications (GUI-web)
    Species and their characteristics, eventually includes cross sections
    Kinetic reactions, rates, characteristics
    Photolysis reactions, j-rate labels, characteristics
    Eventually produces data for photolysis j-rate computation
    Produces output for preprocessor (push or pull?)

Configurator:
  Cconstructs solver for y(1) given y' = delta_t*f(y), y(0)
  host-model aware (CPF, WRF, CESM, BOX) 
     - incorporates external libraries for aerosols, j-rate computation?
  Input: mechanism tag from Cafe
  Input: (stored where?) convergence criteria
  Outputs:
    Species reorderer
    Equation reorderer
    Sparse matrix solver (on reordered system)
    Method to compute f(y)
    Initial Condition collector [y(0)]
    J-rate collector
    K-rate computer
    K-rate collector
    Specifies solver-parameters
       dt
       number of acceptable subdivisions
       error tolerances
       solver (from collection)
    Exception handler (host-model aware)
   
Box model
    Uses methods defined by Configurator 
    Uses solver-parameters defined by Configurator 
    Given y(0) from host model
    Computes tendency y(1)-y(0) or y(1)
