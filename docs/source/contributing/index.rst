============

For all proposed changes (bug fixes, new feature, documentation upates, etc.) please file
and [issue](https://github.com/NCAR/micm/issues/new/choose) detailing what your ask is or what you intend to do.

The NCAR software developers will work with you on that issue to help recommend implementations, work through questions,
or provide other background knowledge.

Any code that you contribute must include associated unit tests or an integration test of some kind. Our tests run across
various platforms and with different configurations automatically. By including tests that exercise your code, you help to
minimize the amount of time debugging platform portability issues.
