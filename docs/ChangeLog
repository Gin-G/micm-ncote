	modified:   src/k_rate_constants.F90
	  - k_rate_const is now forcingParam%k_rateConst

	modified:   src/driver.F90
	  - create register and init sections
	  - add missing _r8
	  - rename k_rateConst

	modified:   src/forcing_and_jacobian.F90
	  - add forcingParam_type and use it
	  - restore force as a function so it may be called directly from rosenbrock

	modified:   src/rosenbrock.dev.F90
	  - restore rosenbrock to its initial state with the addition of passing forcingParam
